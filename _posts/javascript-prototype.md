Learning programming is hard, which is why tutorials are helpful to ease the learning process. However, over-dependence on them can slow your development growth.

Just think of this, you are sitting in front of your computer and ready to learn a new programming language. You start finding tutorials or courses on the internet to have an idea on how to get started. You followed your instructor step by step. But as you continue watching halfway, you just felt your mind is going blank. You don't have a clear idea of how's going on when you start reading your code. All that is left is the feeling of self-doubt and uncertainty.

> I'm done watching this. Did I learn enough? I should watch another tutorial. I need to master this.

If you find yourself going through this experience, well, welcome to tutorial hell. It is a situation where you were dependent on following a tutorial to build or create something. It is a common situation that beginners fall into. I know learning to code on your own is difficult, and I wanted to share my experience on how I got out of tutorial hell.

## Why do we get stuck in Tutorial Hell?

Let us talk first about the reasons why developers stay here.

1. You're doing tutorials to add skill to your resume. You only write the code you followed from the tutorial and not developing that skill.
1. You moved onto another tutorial without adding or refactoring it.
1. You consume information from courses that are pretty similar to beginner level repackaged by different people.
1. You get overwhelmed by the information written or taught in tutorials.

I'm not saying that you should not do tutorials. My point is to use tutorials effectively to escape tutorial hell, improve your learning, and gain skills.

Okay. Let's pave the way towards escaping tutorial hell.
